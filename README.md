This was an assignment which was as follows:

Assignments: Web Portfolios

Consider what you will have on your portfolio to represent your work and abilities as a programmer. Look at examples on the web. Then think of a design for your portfolio’s main page.
How will you allow a user to explore your portfolio content? How will you arrange the work that you’d like them to see? Interesting designs will increase your attractiveness to employers.
Using just a pen and paper, draw some test sketches of what you would like your main portfolio page to look like. Do not use a computer.
You do not have to submit any sketches as part of your assignment.

Once you have decided on how your portfolio page will look, turn its design into a web page. Portfolios will typically use a lot of DIVs, images, and CSS Grid styles.
Place descriptively named classes on your HTML tags so that you can easily adjust the styling of your page(s) later.

Ensure your page looks good on both mobile and desktop. It should be responsive in layout. Use the techniques we’ve learned in class to switch from one layout to another as the browser size changes.
Only use images that you have created yourself, like photos you’ve taken, icons you’ve drawn, or screenshots of your own programs. Do not use any images from the web.
To enhance the page’s design, you can choose a font and color palette that you like, use CSS’s border, margin, corner-radius, gradient, and shadow settings to style your page, and look at the examples at the end of this document for inspiration.


To get a good grade, your portfolio should:
 ❖ ❖ ❖ ❖ ❖
Use CSS Grid for a multi-column layout on desktop
Be responsive and have a one-column layout on mobile Only use images that you’ve created yourself
Not use the CSS float or !important styles
Not use external code libraries, like Bootstrap or Bourbon
